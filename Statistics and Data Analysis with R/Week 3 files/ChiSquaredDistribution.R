# CHI-SQUARED DISTRIBUTION ####

# IF we knew that the population variance (sigma^2) were equal to 1500, what is
# the probability that the sample variance (s^2) of 5 burritos would be greater
# than 2500?



# With 9 degrees of freedom (n = 10), what is the chi-squared value that has
# 5% of the distribution above it?
