# THE T DISTRIBUTION ####

# We collect a sample of the weight (in grams) of 5 Chipotle burritos.  It is
# known that the population mean (ùúá) is 540 grams, but population variance is
# unknown. Sample standard deviation is s = 36.7.

# What is the probability that the average of 5 burritos would be less than 520
# grams?
  


# What is the probability that the average of 5 burritos would be greater than
# 565 grams?



# What is t_0.05,12?



# What is t_alpha/2,15 for alpha = 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.10?
