# A portable communications radio uses 4 AA batteries but can be powered
# successfully using either 4 fresh batteries or a combination of 3 fresh
# batteries and 1 dead battery.  There is a collection of 22 AA batteries
# randomly mixed in a drawer, and 7 of those batteries are dead.  What is the
# probability that a selection of 4 batteries from the drawer, when installed in
# the radio, will power the radio successfully?
