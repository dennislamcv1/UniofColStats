# UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION ####



# You arrive at a red light, which lasts 30 seconds.  (You could have arrived
# just as it turned red or right before it turns green.)  What is the
# probability that you will have to wait between 5 and 10 seconds before it
# turns green?
  


# What is the probability that you will have to wait longer than 20 seconds?



# Use runif to generate 100 random numbers between 20 and 30 that follow the
# uniform distribution.
