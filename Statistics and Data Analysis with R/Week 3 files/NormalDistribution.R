# NORMAL DISTRIBUTION ####

# X is a normally distributed variable with mean = 10 and population standard
# deviation = 4.  What is the probability that X will be less than 6 (i.e., 
# P[X < 6])?



# What is the probability that X will be between 8 and 16 (i.e., P[8 < X < 6])?



# What is the probability that X will be greater than 15 (i.e., P[X > 15])?
