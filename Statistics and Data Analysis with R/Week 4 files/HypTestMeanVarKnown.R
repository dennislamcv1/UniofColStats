# Hypothesis Tests on the Mean, Variance Known ####
# aka one-sample z-test

x <- c(154,129,84,105,189,97,114,92,177,134)

# H0: mu = 100
# H1: mu > 100


# Approach 1: Use formulas


# Approach 2: z.test (TeachingDemos)


# Approach 3: zsum.test (BSDA) - Helpful when all you have are the sample statistics
