# Confidence Interval on the Mean, Variance Known ####

x <- c(154,129,84,105,189,97,114,92,177,134)

# Test assumption of normality:


# Approach 1: Use formulas


# Approach 2: Create user-defined function


# Approach 3: z.test (TeachingDemos)


# Approach 4: zsum.test (BSDA) - useful when only have stats, not the entire data
