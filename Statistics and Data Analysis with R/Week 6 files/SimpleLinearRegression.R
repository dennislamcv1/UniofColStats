# Building a simple linear regression model:


# Easier to define x and y in terms of coffee.data:


# Using the model: What is a prediction for Coffee Consumption when Max Temperature = 33F?


# Plotting the data and adding the model fit:

plot(x, y, main="Coffee Consumption vs. Max Temperature", xlab="Max Temperature (F)", 
     ylab="Coffee Consumption (lb)", col="blue")

# Apply the model to create the model predictions:


# Add a legend


# PART 2

# Significance of and confidence interval on the slope and intercept:


# CI on the mean response


# PI on future response
